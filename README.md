# Crop-Prediction
**Agricultural crop prediction using Machine Learning**
    
The impact of climate change in India, most of the agricultural crops are being badly affected in terms of their performance over a period of the last two decades.Predicting the crop in advance of its harvest would help the policy makers and farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage. Productivity can be improved by understanding and predicting crop through this project. 
    
Machine learning can be defined as one of the AI applications that has successful prediction models in various aspects, such as stock market, weather, business decisions, and crop prediction in this case. An efficient crop prediction system can offer farmers opportunities that can benefit people in a larger context. So, I planned to create a system where machine learning can be used in agriculture for the betterment of farmers. 

I have the aim of adding more attributes to the system and improve the results, which can improve the yields and can recognize several patterns for predictions. This system will be useful to justify which crop can be grown in a particular region. 

Crop production may be a complicated development that's influenced by soil and environmental condition input parameters. Farmers are not any longer looking to use analytics to get data they need to realize actionable insights and take intelligent decisions. Agriculture input parameters vary from field to field and farmer to farmer. The continual increase of human population makes the cultivation of the crops at the proper time and right place even a lot of vital, because the climate is dynamic and therefore the shifts from traditional weather pattern are a lot of frequent than before manufacture. 

Food insecurity may be a drawback that can't be avoided, and humans should build use of latest innovative technologies to create use of existing soil, water and air conditions to get larger crops. The information gap between ancient ways that of cultivating and new agricultural technologies may overcome if a model may be designed to model the interactive impact of climate factors, particularly the impact of events (e.g., heat, rainfalls and excess water) occurring at completely different growing phases of crops. 

The temperature change undoubtedly affects the native and world food production, therefore planning computer code to model crop predictions needs new methodology for temperature change studies, situations for temperature change adaptation, and policymakers which will limit the devastating effects of weather on food provide. The soil sort will modification over time because of weather and pests, therefore crop management must manage a fancy quantity of information, directly or indirectly associated with one another. It will therefore by considering a simplified reality, to permit a quick assessment of the impact of temperature change in agriculture.
